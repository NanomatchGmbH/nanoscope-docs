Basic Version
-------------

Usage of Nanoscope is free for either of two cases:

- Simulations containing only molecules with 40 atoms or fewer
- Systems containing only the molecules in the table below, which were used in our :ref:`user_guide_examples` and :ref:`science_benchmarks`.

Molecules included in **Basic** Version:

How to Cite
^^^^^^^^^^^

When using the **Basic** version of Nanoscope for work that is in any way made public (presentations, journal publications), you need to cite Nanoscope as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    Properties [list properties and compounds] were computed using the Nanoscope software provided by Nanomatch GmbH.
    Nanoscope is available at https://nanoscope.readthedocs.io

Academic and Professional Versions
----------------------------------

For unlimited usage (**Academic** or **Professional**), you need to purchase a commercial license from Nanomatch GmbH.
Please contact us at (info@nanomatch.com) for details.
